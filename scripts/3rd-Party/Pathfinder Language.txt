# Generates lost tongues and ancient languages "Ancient"
# Dwarven, Elven, Draconic, and Serpentfolk are simply made up
# to add variety and re-add languages that have been around more
# than 10,000 years. Likewise, Abyssal, Infernal, and Celestial
# were active languages. Old Kelesh and Old Taldane are
# inventions to give flavor for things 2,000-5,000 years old.
