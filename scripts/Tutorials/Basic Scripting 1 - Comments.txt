# The most simple comment is a line comment, everything
# on that line is not read by the engine

/*
  This is a block comment anything in-between the open and
  close is not read by the engine and can cross multiple
  lines without the need to make sure it is still a comment
*/

/*
  Comments are handy for adding in information about what
  the script is doing so that you or others can look at
  it and know exactly what a certain piece of the script
  is doing.

  Comments are also handy for adding in header and footer
  information, like who made the script, copyright,
  sources, any changes, etc..

  If you were to try and run this script now you would
  get an error saying group Start could not be found.
  This is because this script is only composed of comments.
